The goal of **rdracor** is to provide an R interface for the [DraCor API](https://dracor.org/documentation/api) (DraCor: Drama Corpora Project). Website of the project: [dracor.org](https://dracor.org).

## Installation


``` r
#install.packages("remotes") #if you don't have remotes installed
remotes::install_github("dracor-org/rdracor")
```

## General info on corpora

Retrieving general information about available corpora:

```{r example}
library(rdracor)
```

```{r}
corpora <- get_dracor_meta()
summary(corpora)
plot(corpora)
```

## Plays in the corpus

```{r}
ru <- get_dracor(corpus = "rus")
summary(ru)
```

You can get all corpora at once:

```{r}
all <- get_dracor()
summary(all)
```

## Play network

You can extract a network (undirected weighted graph) for a specific play:

```{r}
godunov <- play_igraph(play = "pushkin-boris-godunov", corpus = "rus")
```

This will create an object of S3 class `"play_igraph"` that inherits from `"igraph"`. 
It means that you can work with it as an `"igraph"` object:

```{r}
library(igraph)
edge_density(godunov)
diameter(godunov, weights = NA)
graph.cohesion(godunov)
```

You can plot the graph: `plot()` will use plot method for `igraph` objects with some adjusted parameters. For example, vertices are coloured based on the gender and shape is based on whether a character is a group:

```{r}
plot(godunov)
```

In addition, you can get a summary with network properties and gender distribution:  

```{r}
summary(godunov)
```

## Text of the play

You can get text of a play in different forms:

- as a raw TEI (optionally parsed with {xml2})

```{r}
get_play_tei(play = "pushkin-boris-godunov", corpus = "rus")
```

- as a character vector:

```{r}
text_godunov <- get_play_spoken_text(play = "pushkin-boris-godunov", corpus = "rus")
head(text_godunov)
```

- as a data frame:

```{r}
get_play_text_df(play = "pushkin-boris-godunov", corpus = "rus")
```
