The goal of rdracor is to provide an R interface for the [Drama Corpora Project (Dracor) API]( https://dracor.org/documentation/api). More on Dracor project [here](https://dracor.org). 

## Installation


``` r
#install.packages("devtools") #if you don't have devtools installed
devtools::install_github("dracor-org/rdracor")
```

## General info on corpora

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rdracor)
get_dracor_api_info()## basic example code
```

```{r}
corpora <- get_dracor()
summary(corpora)
corpora
```

## Plays in the corpus

```{r}
ru <- get_corpus("rus")
head(ru)
summary(ru)
ru_au <- authors(ru)
head(ru_au)
summary(ru_au)
plot(ru_au, top_minplays = 4)
```

## Play network

You can extract network for a specific play:
```{r}
godunov <- get_play_igraph(corpus = "rus", 
                           play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
```

This will create an object of S3 class `"play_igraph"` that is heritated from `"igraph"`. It means that you can work with it as an `"igraph"` object:

```{r}
library(igraph)
edge_density(godunov)
diameter(godunov)
graph.cohesion(godunov)
```

You can plot it, the default parameters are adjusted to the specific of the corpus. For examples, vertices are coloured based on the gender and shape is based on whether a character is a group:

```{r}
plot(godunov)
```

## Other commands

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_play_cast(corpus = "rus", 
              play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_metadata(corpus = "rus", 
                  play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_metrics(corpus = "rus", 
                 play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_networkdata_csv(corpus = "rus", 
                         play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_networkdata_gexf(corpus = "rus", 
                         play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_rdf(corpus = "rus", 
             play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_spoken_text(corpus = "rus", 
                     play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_spoken_text_bych(corpus = "rus", 
                          play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_stage_directions(corpus = "rus", 
                          play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_stage_directions_with_sp(corpus = "rus", 
                                  play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
get_play_tei(corpus = "rus", 
             play = "pushkin-boris-godunov")
